# MATRIX_LIBRARY

This is a project that implements common matrix operations in the c programming language

## HEADER FILES

- './matrix.c' is the only header file and currently contains certain function declaration needed to implement basic matrix operations

## SOURCE FILES

- './matrix.c' is the source file for the implementation of each matrix operation. Thus far, this library can do transpose, multiplication, scalar multiplication and inverse as well as find determinant. More to come in the future

## ADDITIONAL FILES

- './matrix_script.py' this python file is sort of a whiteboard for the implemented functions of the library where I experimented and analyzed my code and then rewrote it in C.

- './main.c' this is the main function where you can implement test of your liking

## To run the program:

1. Navigate to the project directory using `cd`.
2. Ensure the `run.sh` file has execute permissions by running `chmod +x run.sh`.
3. Execute the script by running `./run.sh`.
4. The out file is in the './build' directory
